## Changes

Updated for patch 3.4.2.

### Roll column

Switched to a new system that's much lighter on comms for propergating the automatic random rolls. This should fix the issues some people have with the last few sessions not receiving random rolls.

This change is not backwards compatible, once the ML upgrades, everyone will have to in order to see the random rolls.

### Trophy of the Crusade

Is now considered an armor token for buttons and responses. Also added ilvl data.

### Voting Frame session buttons

Selecting an awarded session now shows a yellow checkmark instead of nothing on the session button.

## Bugfixes

- *History now records the correct response instead of "Awarded" when awarding multiple copies of the same item to a player.*
- *Voting frame rows should no longer be jumping around excessively.*
